# NoteBooker

## Description

My motivation for this project was to make an easy way to generate logos in case I need help kickstarting any ideas for branding logos in the future!
With this project, all I have to do is answer 4 easy questions and I have a starting point for a simple logo design to be used as is or to be modified.
With this project, I learned how SVGs work and I was able to render code stored as template literals to fast track making SVGs.
